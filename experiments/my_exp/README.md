## [AlphaNLI](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/anli/submissions/public)
Abductive Natural Language Inference (aNLI) is a new commonsense benchmark dataset designed to test an AI systemâ€™s capability to apply abductive reasoning and common sense to form possible explanations for a given set of observations. Formulated as a binary-classification task, the goal is to pick the most plausible explanatory hypothesis given two observations from narrative contexts.

To get start you need to download data from https://leaderboard.allenai.org/anli/submissions/public, then run `run_anli.sh`.
